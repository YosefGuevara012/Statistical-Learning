#### Applied


8. This exercise relates to the College data set, which can be found in
the file **College.csv**. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US.

a) Use the **read.csv()** function to read the data into R. Call the
loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set
to the correct location for the data.

```{r}
college <- read.csv("https://uclspp.github.io/datasets/data/College.csv")
```


(b) Look at the data using the **fix()** function. You should notice
that the first column is just the name of each university.We donâ€™t
really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to
have these names for later. Try the following commands:

```{r}
rownames(college) = college[,1]
fix (college )
```

You should see that there is now a row.names column with the
name of each university recorded. This means that R has given
each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R
will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However,
we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the
names are stored. Try

```{r}
college =college [,-1:-2]
fix (college )
```

Now you should see that the first data column is Private. Note
that another column labeled row.names now appears before the
Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather
the name that R is giving to each row.

(c) i. Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary
of the variables in the data set.


```{r}
summary(college)
```
ii. Use the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of
the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that
you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using
A[,1:10].

```{r}
pairs(college)
```
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("1.PNG")
```
